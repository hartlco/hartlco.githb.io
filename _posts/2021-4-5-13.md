It's the long Easter break here in Germany and I really needed those few days off from work. Before the pandemic, we always travelled when taking vacation. Being on the go and constantly in a new environment makes it easier for me to switch off work and mentally relax. It took a while to acknowledge that vacations are still needed, even though you are 24/7 in your "office".

## PC
See..., in comparison to previous posts, I dropped the `Gaming` in front of the headline. I remembered I still had good SSDs built in a retired Mac Mini from 2012. I decided to extract it and also install it in the PC, as I wanted to set up a Linux/Dev environment without messing with the Windows/Bootloader installation. A dedicated second drive makes this just simpler. I have been interested in trying out [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) after reading about it from [Orta](https://orta.io/on/migrating/from/apple). Installation was quick, setting up VS Code and the Rust environment was also easy enough. I'm still struggling with the text-editing shortcuts, especially on a Mac keyboard, but I will get used to it. Let's see if and how I'm going to use this setup for actual productive tasks.

## Blog
Many more micro-posts have been moved to the [log](https://hartl.co/log). I slowly start experimenting with migrating this site, trying to keep all deep links and URLs in place.

Bye!
