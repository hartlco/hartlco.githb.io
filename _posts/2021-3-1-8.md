It's time for another short one.

## Development
Almost all features I wanted for [Loc](https://github.com/hartlco/Loc), my privacy-focused location tracker, are now implemented. I already use it every day. Mainly to discover the days I went for a walk or bought groceries from the stores. Oh well...
As it already has a badly designed App-Icon, I'm wondering if I should consider submitting it to the App Store, or just have it open-source.

## Reading
**Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea by Barbara Demick**: I'm currently gravitating towards books focusing on the post-WW2-era, the cold-war, and its fallouts. This book about North Korea fits right in there. It leaves no space for illusions how life in this dictatorship looks like. Brutal and eye-opening. Full recommendation.

## Watching
WandaVision remains the only new thing we are currently watching on TV. I'm sad that it will be over soon. As it's available on Netflix, we started a re-watch of New Girl ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Bye!
