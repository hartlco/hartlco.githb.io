We are coming close to 10 consecutive weekly posts.

## Development
I'm continuing the work on [Loc](https://github.com/hartlco/loc). This project distracted my from finalizing my local-notification library, but I'm not too worried. Loc has a tiny scope and could be feature-complete soon. I will just come back to it.

As I'm mainly focusing on Swift/iOS these days, I felt the need to keep my Rust knowledge fresh in my head. For this, I started following this tutorial: [Hecto: Build your own text editor in Rust](https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto/). I was aware of all concepts touched so far[^1] but I'm happy to reapply them.

## Writing
I managed to write a small blog posts about [releasing private pods using GitHub actions](https://hartl.co/2021/03/07/release-private-pods-github-actions.html). I had this note for a while, and I'm happy I finally wrote it down as a post. Let's hope it doesn't take another year until I write down one of my many other notes. 

## Reading
**Midnight in Chernobyl: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Nuclear Disaster by Adam Higginbotham**: Again, this books fits right in the era I'm currently reading about. After watching a few documentaries about the Chernobyl disaster, I was already aware about many details concerning the explosion and the fallout. This book goes even deeper by following the personal lives of people involved, and looking closely at the political landscape of that time. Full recommendation.

## Apps
This week I discovered [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org). It's an open-source grammar, style, and spell checker. A perfect replacement for grammarly that always felt a little creepy. LanguageTool also supports many more languages.

Bye!
